# React Native Rich Editor

This project demonstrates how to build a basic Richt Text Editor for React Native from scartch.

The only dependency it has is a WebView.

In order to run the demo just execute `cd ./demo` and from there start `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.

To see the usage of the editor just open [App.tsx](./demo/App.tsx) file.

Check description [here](https://ievgen.de/2020/06/01/simplest-rich-text-editor-for-react-native/) if you're interested in details.

I hope it helps on your way of building something amazing.
